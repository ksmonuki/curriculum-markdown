## Research Experience

**January 2018-present** <br>
**Barber Lab Undergraduate Research Scholar; University of California, Los Angeles** - Senior Honors Thesis research in Dr. Paul Barber’s Lab in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology department through the Undergraduate Research Scholars Program. Analyzed environmental DNA (eDNA) in ocean water samples across ocean depths to improve sampling methodology. Data will inform an upcoming community science partnership between Heal the Bay Marine Protected Areas Watch Program and the Barber Lab. Performed PCR and indexing reactions and analyzed the eDNA sequences recovered via sequencing pipelines. 

**June 2018-September 2018** <br>
**Bracken Lab Junior Specialist; University of California, Irvine** - Worked in Dr. Matthew Bracken’s Lab in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department as a research assistant for an NSF project analyzing the bottom-up and top-down relationships between rocky intertidal herbivores and microalgal communities. Was a Project Lead at the Corona Del Mar, California site. Led biodiversity surveys and photosynthetic activity measurements in the field and nutrient analyses in lab.

**September 2017 - December 2017** <br>
**Marine Biology Quarter Participant; University of California, Los Angeles** - Conducted research as part of a five-week program in Queensland, Australia. Studied stingray feeding pit distributions across beaches on North Stradbroke Island at the Moreton Bay Research Station and presented the research at the Heron Island Research Station.

**June 2016 - September 2018** <br>
**Sorte Lab Junior Specialist; University of California, Irvine** - Worked for two summers as a junior specialist in Dr. Cascade Sorte's Lab, an intertidal ecology lab in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department. Conducted field surveys, ran a pH titrator in the lab, and performed mussel temperature tolerance experiments. Also participated as a research assistant in September 2018 on a project to assess stressors in the rocky intertidal in Sitka, Alaska. 

**September 2016 - June 2017** <br>
**Ambrose Lab Undergraduate Researcher; University of California, Los Angeles** - Conducted research in Dr. Richard Ambrose's lab in the Department of Environmental Health Sciences at UCLA. Studied stormwater biofilters in Los Angeles, focusing specifically on how biofilters sequester carbon and reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide levels.

**September 2016 - June 2017** <br>
**Grand Challenges Undergraduate Research Scholar; University of California, Los Angeles** - Conducted a group research project consisting of surveys to assess how Los Angelenos's attitudes towards sustainability aligned with the objectives of the UCLA Sustainability Grand Challenge (100% renewable energy, 100% locally sourced water, and enhanced ecosystem health).

## Leadership Experience

**September 2018 - present** <br>
**Director; UCLA Mixed Student Union** - Directed Mixed Student Union, a student-run club that discusses topics concerning people of mixed race (been an active member since 2015). Ran club meetings, organized club finances, and prepared for the annual conference in Spring.

**Fundraising Chair; UCLA Mixed Student Union** - Managed fundraising for the Mixed Student Union. Managed funds for club events, including the annual conference.

## Extracurricular Activities

**January 2018 - present** <br>
**Mentor; Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Undergraduate Association** - Served as an upperclassman mentor to an underclassman mentee as part of the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Undergraduate Association. Assisted in college course planning, suggested involvement in extracurricular activities, and offered advice in both academic and non-academic matters. Organized one-on-one meetings with the mentee and attended group meetings with other mentor-mentee pairs.

**April 2016- June 2017** <br>
